Jaanga Terrain provides multiple ways of viewing the [SRTM 30 Plus]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-srtm30-plus-r2/terrain-srtm30-plus.html ) data source from
the [Scripps Institution of Oceanography]( https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ ).

Notes: 

* Elevations are highly exaggerated - in a game-like fashion - perhaps due to an over-exuberance of 3D happiness
	* Viewers contain slider that enable you to control the scale of the vertical elevation
* Each viewer has a read me file that includes a list of bugs/issues as well as a road map of what's likely to appear next
* This work is at an early stage and not yet prepared for general usage
	* The apps are being built and tested on Windows 8.1 using the latest Chrome browser.
	* Any other configuration - ie iPad or MacBook Air - is not likely to work

A full featured viewer. Displays terrain as if the Earth is a plane. Start here to explore the possibilities of news ways of visualizing digital elevation models.

Currently the most worked-out, well-developed viewer.

The name unFlatland is a play on the [Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatland ) a satirical novella written in 1884. 
The title is relevant because though the unFlatland scripts flatten the globe out into a plane the plane ends uo full of bumps and dimples.
