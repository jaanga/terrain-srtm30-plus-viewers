Jaanga Terrain provides multiple ways of viewing the SRTM 30 Plus data

Notes: 

* Elevations are highly exaggerated - in a game-like fashion - in an over-exuberance of 3D happiness
* Each viewer has a read me file that includes a list of bugs/issues as well as a road map of what's likely to appear next
* This work is at an early stage and not yet prepared for general usage
	* The apps are being built and tested on Windows 8.1 using the latest Chrome browser.
	* Any other configuration - ie iPad or MacBook Air - is not likely to work

	* The container that reads the content file and the menu file
	* Could be built using jQuery or any other UI library
* png-tms7-viewer-3d-menu.md
	* Menu file created using Markdown syntax
* template-png-tms7-viewer-3d.html
	* Standalone file to be loaded within an iframe
	* Loads, contains and process all 3D interaction
	* Completely workable when not in an iframe
	* Enables two-communication with parent when within an iframe
