[Satellite Geodesy research group at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD]( http://topex.ucsd.edu/WWW_html/srtm30_plus.html )

Provides low resolution data obtained from a 512 x 256 PNG height map ( or about 1 data point for every 1.4 degrees) 
from data extracted from the much larger SRTM30 Plus data set.
